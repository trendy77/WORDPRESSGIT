With Post Formats, the new approach allows a theme to add support for a Post Format (e.g. add_theme_support('post-formats', array('aside'))), and then the post format can be selected in the Publish meta box when saving the post. A function call of get_post_format($post->ID) can be used to determine the format, and post_class() will also create the "format-asides" class, for pure-css styling.

shortcodes can be embedded in your email to configure various aspects of the published post:
[category x,y,z]
[excerpt]some excerpt[/excerpt]
[tags x,y,z]
[delay +1 hour]
[comments on | off]
[status publish | pending | draft | private]
[slug some-url-name]
[title Your post title]
[end] – everything after this shortcode is ignored (i.e. signatures). Make sure it’s on its own line with a blank line above it.
[slideshow] – replaces the auto-gallery with a slideshow
[nogallery] – disables the auto-gallery and displays all images inline
[more] – more tag
[nextpage] – pagination
[publicize off|yahoo|twitter|facebook] – change Publicize options (see below)
[poll]question and answers[/poll] – insert a Polldaddy poll into your post (see below)
Shortcodes can be included anywhere in the body of your email and must be in lowercase. There should be no spaces between the left square braket and the shortcode content.
